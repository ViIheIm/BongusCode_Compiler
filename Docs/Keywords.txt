Symposium:
Just a struct, like in C++. This was also the first keyword I ever decided to include in this language.


Oblivie(forget):


Misericordia(pity):


Nihil:
Just like void in C++.


Ordinata(array):


Colludium(game):


Claudere(close):
Just the return keyword.


Vocare(summon):
Should probably be the equivalent to malloc(). This should be a separate function though.


Perdere(destroy):
Should probably be the equivalent to free(). Should also be a function.


Acatalectica(verse in which no syllable is wanting in the last foot).


Viviscere(To live):
Main function name.
